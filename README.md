# Clinical-Trial-Analysis

Here is the analyses related to the clinical data. All of codes are written in RMarkdown. For each analysis, I used programming language R and SAS to process the analysis as well as do the data visualization.  

The topics of the clinical analysis include: Leprosy & Osteoporosis, Postoperative pain & CRD, and Rheumatoid arthritis & Cervical dystonia.
